Hi, thank you for being interested in the project.

Just to inform you that I've fixed a [critical bug](https://github.com/chenyuntc/cmr/commit/a0a8df4f48f9fcb751c11d93ae20210632c28d39)  in CMR (for training), please merge from [my repo](https://github.com/chenyuntc/cmr) 

I can't create an issue, so I open a fake pull request (you might just close it after reading this)
